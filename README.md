# Banhammer
 
This [game](https://ageneric.itch.io/banhammer) was originally made in 48 hours for
the [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023). The
original build may be found on the `original-jam-version` branch.

The code is not optimised or ideal, as it was written for the jam only.
Please don't take this as an example!

Made using Unity with WebGL for the web build.
